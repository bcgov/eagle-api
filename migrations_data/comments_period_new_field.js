    "description" : "This comment period was open from January 26th 2016 to April 11th 2016.This Public Comment Period (PCP) was carried out as an “alpha” product of the EAO Systems Modernization (ESM) project, through which the EAO applied leading-edge processes and technology to enhance the way it, amongst other things, engages with the public in a more transparent and collaborative fashion. One outcome of the ESM project is this new EAO Project Information & Collaboration system (EPIC) via which, going forward, the EAO will be conducting Public Comment Periods, including a subsequent PCP on the proposed Ajax Project, commencing August 8th, 2017. The “alpha” Ajax PCP website, previously available at ajax.projects.eao.gov.bc.ca, has been decommissioned; the comments received during that PCP can be found archived in the Related Documents section below.   For more information regarding the ESM project and the EAO’s approach to building systems and enhancing transparency, please visit http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/EPIC/. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via epicsupport.eao@gov.bc.ca."
