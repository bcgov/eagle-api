# How to seed local database

This functionality is temporarily out of service.  

It was imported from a different project and will either be updated to work with the current schema, or replaced by something else.

For now, the following steps should be disregarded.

1. Start with an empty database -- except for *users* collection with *admin* document.
1. In a bash window, in project root folder, run API (**npm start**).
1. In another bash window, change to *seed* sub-folder and run seed (**npm start**).
